## i3-configs
This repository contains my i3 configs. The i3bar includes uptime, upload/download rates, % CPU used, RAM usage, CPU load, core temperatures (set up for my system in particular so may not work for others) and time. For these configs to work out-of-the-box one needs to have LXTerminal and Spectacle installed. If you do not want to use these apps and want to use alternative apps edit .i3/config accordingly. Likewise these configs are set up for PCs with 5 cores or more.
