## i3-configs
This repository contains my i3 configs. The i3bar includes uptime, upload/download rates, % CPU used, RAM usage, CPU load, core temperatures (set up for my system in particular so may not work for others) and time. For these configs to work out-of-the-box one needs to have LXTerminal installed.
