## i3-configs
![The configs as of 27 May 2017 running on Gentoo Linux with i3 4.13](https://fusion809.github.io/images/desktop-environments/i3-4.13-my-configs-27May2017.png)

This repository contains my i3 configs. The i3bar includes uptime, upload/download rates, % CPU used, RAM usage, CPU load, core temperatures (set up for my system in particular so may not work for others) and time. 

## Requirements
For these configs to work out-of-the-box one needs to have LXTerminal (for the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to open a terminal) and Spectacle installed (so that one can take screenshots with <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>). 

## Customization
If you do not want to use these apps (LXTerminal and Spectacle) and want to use alternative apps edit `~/.i3/config` accordingly. Likewise these configs are set up for PCs with 5 or more cores. If your screen is small and the i3bar does not seem to fit properly on your screen I would suggest editing the font setting line in `~/.i3/config` accordingly.
